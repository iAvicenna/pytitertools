this is a wrapper around the R package called titertools:

>>https://github.com/shwilks/titertools

Therefore you need to have R installed, the package above installed and also need to install
rpy2 which mediates the connection between R and python. If using conda enviroments, you need to make sure rpy2 is configured correctly. My recommendation is to install R in base and rpy2 in whatever enviroment you 

If installing rpy2 into a conda environment and R is installed in base then first install pip into the enviroment by (while in the environment)

>>conda install pip

then install rpy2 from the base (and not in the conda environment but while in the base)

>>path_to_environment/bin/pip install rpy2

later check that rpy2 uses the correct R installation by 

>>python3 -m rpy2.situation

if the installation is made from the base environment using pip, then this should print
R RHOME as the R installed in the base. In not it might fail to find the titertools package that is installed in the R base.
